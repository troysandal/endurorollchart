#1 - I found a bug in ECR in how they compute the end time of reset rows.  I verified this by adding a Note at the same distance that the reset ends on.  In theory this Note should have the same Start Time as the reset End Time but they don't.

#2 - The note at 39.99 has a Start Time of 9:59:59 but we calculate it to 9:58:58.28571429.  Note the decimal component will round down.  Not sure how ECR got this wrong.
