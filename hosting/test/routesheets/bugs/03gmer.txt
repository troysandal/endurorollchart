The bug in ECR manifests itself with consecutive resets.  The Start Time of the second reset below is 1 second too high.  I believe this is because they are computing the Start Time of the 2nd reset using the previous reset's Start Time.  Because Resets don't have to be on 1/10th's of a m/km their time may/can have a fractional component which will introduce this error.

The only way to fix this was to modify the exported route sheet - see below.
